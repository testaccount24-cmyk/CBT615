While I may have contributed these to the CBT Tape they didn't
come from me originally.Â  I don't recall where I found them but I
did (could have been the Guide ISPF tools tape).

I'd rather not take credit other than for just sending them to
you to share.

Thank you
Lionel B. Dyck (Contractor)

Note from Sam Golob:  Lionel, you did modify some of them.
